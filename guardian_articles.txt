Canada’s Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, has lost his own seat in the country’s general election, in a stunning blow for the 45-year-old career politician who until recently had beenwidely expected tobecome the country’s next prime minister.
Although Conservatives increased both their seat count and vote share,Mark Carney’s Liberal party secured control of parliament, and Poilievre’s defeat in the Carleton electoral district is certain to fuel mounting questions over his future as party leader.
Once considered a long shot, the Liberal party candidate Bruce Fanjoy flipped the Carleton riding which Poilievre had held for seven consecutive elections. The two men were among 91 candidates on the ballot – most of whom were part of a protest calling for electoral reform.
In a speech late on Monday, Poilievre conceded the election, but pledged to stay on as Conservative leader, saying it was an “honour” to hold the role.
“To my fellow Conservatives, we have much to celebrate tonight. We’ve gained well over 20 seats,” Poilievre said. “We are cognizant of the fact that we didn’t quite get over the finish line. Yet we know that change is needed, but change is hard to come by. It takes time.”
But without a seat in the House of Commons, Poilievre cannot serve as leader of the official opposition, and it is alsounclear if he can retain his residenceat Stornoway, the official residence of the opposition leader.
If he does stay on as leader, Poilievre will need a Conservative MP to sacrifice their seat, allowing to him run in the by-election to fill the vacancy. That process takes time – Canada’s governor general must call the election between 11 and 180 days after being notified of the seat vacancy – and in all likelihood, Poilievre would not be able to return to parliament until the fall sitting.
In recent weeks, Conservative officials confirmed to the Guardian that there was growing tension within the party over Poilievre’s leadership – and speculation that he would soon be forced out.
“There will be a need for bloodletting,” said one senior member. “That could be the leader, or it could be the campaign manager. But there are some who feel the party fell far short of its goal – to win. And there is a price.”
Poilievre became the youngest MP in Canadian history at the age of 25, and became Conservative leader in 2022. A sharp-tongued political brawler who cultivated a populist image, he became a lightning rod for discontent with the former prime ministerJustin Trudeauover whom he at one point enjoyed a 25-point lead.
WhenDonald Trumpbegan to threaten Canada’s economy and autonomy – and then Trudeau stood down to be replaced by Mark Carney – Poilievre found himself on the wrong side of a surge of patriotic anger.
Despite Poilievre’s personal defeat, the Conservatives did, however, win enough seats to form the largest official opposition in Canadian history at the expense of other opposition parties.
And Poilievre was not the only party leader to lose his place in parliament: Jagmeet Singh, leader of the progressive New Democrats also failed to retain his Burnaby seat as the party saw its vote share collapse.
“It’s been the honour of my life to represent the people of Burnaby Central,” he said in an emotional speech, in which he announced his resignation as party leader. “Tonight they chose a new member of parliament and I wish them well.”
The New Democrats – who held the balance of power after the 2021 federal election – were on track to lose 17 of the 24 seats they had in the last parliament and are likely to lose official party status.
The loss of party status means the NDP will lose certain parliamentary privileges, including the ability to ask questions during question period as often as recognized parties. The NDP will also lose out on accessing money allocated to parties for research purposes, which is distributed proportionally to the number of seats held by a recognized party.
The Green party’s co-leader Jonathan Pedneault also lost his bid to represent a district in Montreal.

제목: Trump warns ‘nothing will stop me’ at rally to celebrate 100 days in office

본문:
Donald Trump has celebrated his 100th day in office witha campaign-style rallyin Michigan and an attack on “communist radical left judges” for trying to seize his power, warning: “Nothing will stop me.”
The president also served up the chilling spectacle of a video of Venezuelan immigrants sent from the US to a notorious prison in El Salvador, accompanied by Hollywood-style music and roars of approval from the crowd.
Trump’s choice of Michigan was a recognition not only of how the battleground state helpedpropel him to victoryover Vice-President Kamala Harris in last November’s election, but its status as a potential beneficiary of a tariffs policy which, he claims, will revive US manufacturing.
But the cavernous sports and expo centre in the city of Warren, near Detroit, was only half full for the rally, and a steady stream of people left before the end of his disjointed and meandering 89-minute address.
“We’re here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country!” Trump declared. “In 100 days, we have delivered the most profound change in Washington in nearly 100 years.”
The 45th and 47th president falsely accused the previous administration of engineering massive border invasion and allowing gangs, cartels and terrorists to infiltrate communities. “Democrats have vowed mass invasion and mass migration,” he said. “We are delivering mass deportation.”
Trump defended his use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime authority that allows the president to detain or deport the citizens of an enemy nation, to expel foreign terrorist from the US as quickly as possible. Thenhe took aim at that courtsthat have blocked many of his moves during the first 100 days.
“We cannot allow a handful of communist, radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement of our laws and assume the duties that belong solely to the president of the United States,” Trump said, with evident frustration. “Judges are trying to take away the power given to the president to keep our country safe.
“It’s not a good thing, but I hope for the sake of our country that the supreme court is going to save this, because we have to do something. These people are just looking to destroy our country. Nothing will stop me in the mission to keep America safe again.”
In a darkly theatrical touch, Trump encouraged the crowd to watch big screens that showed mainly Venezuelan alleged gang members deported from the USarriving last month in El Salvadorand having their heads shaved or being manhandled by guards.
The video, originally shared by El Salvador’s authoritarian president Nayib Bukele, was accompanied by moody music reminiscent of a thriller. Once it was over the big screens offered the simple message, “100 days of greatness”, while the crowd cheered raucously and broke into chants of: “USA! USA! USA!”
The arena was surrounded by banners that read, “Investing in America”, “Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!”, “The Golden Age”, “Buy American, Hire American” and “The American Dream is Back”. Trump’s supporters held signs with slogans such as: “Make America Great Again” and “Golden Age of America”. Michigan’s unemployment rate has risen for three straight months.
One person behind the president waved a “Trump 2028”, banner even though he is constitutionally barred from serving a third term. At one pointMargo Martin, a White House aide, joined the president on stage and asked: “Trump 2028, anybody?” The crowd roared.
Before the rally, warm-up tracks included It’s A Man’s World by James Brown and Luciano Pavarotti, Nothing Compares 2 U by Sinéad O’Connor and YMCA by Village People. There were video clips of Elton John and the Who singing Pinball Wizard in the movie Tommy, and factory worker turned country singer Oliver Anthony performingRich Men North of Richmond.
Yet despite the ostensible celebration of his election win and hugely consequential first 100 days, Trump spent much of the rally in campaign mode, fixated on past grudges and grievances.
He mocked Biden’s mental acuity and even how he appears in a bathing suit, repeated the lie that he won the 2020 election and sought to discredit polling and news coverage unflattering to him. “When you watch the fake news you see fake polls,” he said, without evidence. “In legitimate polls I think we’re in the 60s, the 70s.”
Trump defended his administration’s steep tariffs on cars and auto parts, hours after the White House announced it was softening them. He boasted of ending diversity, equity and inclusion “bullshit” across the federal government and private sector, and of making it official government policy that there are only two genders.
He reiterated support for the beleaguered defence secretaryPete Hegseth, telling the crowd: “I have so much confidence in him. The fake news is after him, but he’s a tough cookie. They don’t know how tough he is.”
Trump also heaped praise on his billionaire ally Elon Musk and his “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, and condemned the backlash against the Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur: “It’s not fair what they’ve done to him. That is a disgrace.”
The rally featured guest speeches by Brian Pannebecker, a retired car worker who pitched a book he is writing about his support of Trump, and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller,who said earnestly: “Thank you, President Trump, for being the greatest president in American history.”
Democrats take a different view.Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: “Trump’s pathetic display tonight will do nothing to help the families he started screwing over 100 days ago.
“Michiganders and the rest of the country see right through Trump, and as a result, he has the lowest 100-day approval rating in generations. If he’s not already terrified of what the ballot box will bring between now and the midterm elections, he should be.”

제목: Cocaine, corruption and bribes: the German port under siege by Europe’s criminal drug gangs
링크: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/cocaine-corruption-bribes-german-port-under-siege-europe-criminal-drug-gangs-hamburg
본문:
In Hamburg’s spring sunshine, 200,000-tonne cargo ships almost half a mile long, piled high with the same weight in shipping containers, are docked quayside along the Elbe River. Cranes slowly offload the metal boxes packed with everything from raw materials to food and electronics, and, in some, cocaine.
Between 2018 and 2023 cocaine seizures rose by 750%, marking outGermanyas another major European hub in the ever-expanding global trade. But the influx is not just ramping up addiction, it is also fuelling corruption in a country perceived as being one of the least corrupt in the world.
“We are seeing ​​an infiltration of the port infrastructure in Hamburg, bribing of police officers in exchange for information and lately a state attorney awaiting trial for [allegedly] leaking information to a cocaine trafficking network,” said Daniel Brombacher, who runs theEuropebureau at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.
In 2021, police announced Europe’s biggest ever seizure of cocaine at the port: 16 tonnes of high-purity powder stashed in 1,700 wall-putty tins shipped from Paraguay to Hamburg. The lead public prosecutor in that case was in court last week accused of being on the payroll of the same gang he was supposed to be prosecuting.
The man, named as Yashar G, is accused of leaking investigation details to the gang and warning suspects of their imminent arrest in return for €5,000 (£4,250) a month. He was arrested in October by police monitoring the gang’s encrypted communications – when police raided the network shortly after the Hamburg seizure, key targets had already fled to Dubai. Yashar G is also accused of leaking sensitive information to other drug gangs. He denies all allegations against him.
Cocaine production in Colombia and its consumption in western Europe are hitting record highs. So too is the money being made by European organised crime networks distributing a product worth more by weight than platinum. A kilo of cocaine is worth $2,000 in Colombia, but once in Europe its value rockets to an average of $40,000. Profits from this huge mark-up are not just spent on luxury cars and villas, but used to smooth the path for the next shipment as the gangster creep digs its tentacles into countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Germany.
Hamburg, the European Union’s third largest port is one of its most targeted ports by drug gangs, according to Europol. Insiders known ashafeninnentäter(including dock and shipping workers, security guards and truck drivers) move the drugs unnoticed. Two Hamburg port workers were this month jailed for helping transport 480kg of cocaine from Ecuador and enabling a physical attack on a colleague who threatened the plot.
Police have launched a publicity campaign to help port workers fend off drug gangs trying to recruit or extort them, but Hamburg’s port security forces feel so under threat they last year demanded submachine guns. In one incident Belgian police tipped off Hamburg’s port police that an armed French drug gang was planning a raid to recover seized cocaine.
Cocaine’s profits meanwhile spill out on to Hamburg’s streets. “Karl”, a former bouncer in the city’s red light district, said money from cocaine has become increasingly visible in the last five years. “Every weekend you see more and more young men in Ferraris, Lamborghinis and €150,000 SUVs,” he said. “This is not money earned from prostitution, or scams or cannabis. This is cocaine money.”
A series of cases in Germany have also highlighted alleged corruption within police ranks: an officer in the south-western state of Baden-Württemberg arrested this month on suspicion of being on the Italian ‘Ndrangheta mafia’s payroll, a senior police officer in Hanover suspected of taking bribes from a drug trafficking network arrested in January, a drug squad officer arrested near Frankfurt in November on charges of “aiding and abetting” drug dealers and a police officer arrested in Bonn in August who was accused of passing classified information to members of the Dutch-Moroccan mafia, big players in Europe’s drug trade.
“The cocaine bonanza that we have witnessed in Germany and the EU in the past decade has led to an unprecedented influx of cash into organised crime,” said Brombacher. “Organised crime groups have never had so much venture capital available, and also never before such a strong incentive to invest in bribing to make sure the business keeps moving.”
Hamburg Port Authority said issues linked to port security were dealt with by Hamburg police. In a statement, a spokesperson for the police said: “International organised criminal groups are often recruiting employees of the port industry in order to support the smuggling of cocaine from South America into Germany and Europe via the port of Hamburg. These so-called ‘internal port offenders’ are playing a particular key role in this kind of illegal drug importation.”
The spokesperson said the police, alongside customs, the port authority and the private sector, were “making significant efforts to combat this issue”. They added: “So far, cases of bribed police officers have not been proven in Hamburg in this context.”
Organised crime experts have warned that the true nature of corruption brought by drug trafficking networks remains hidden.
“Germany has found it very difficult to admit its problem with organised crime and still today it is largely in denial. The sudden influx of cocaine has just started to make the problem visible,” said Zora Hauser, a criminologist at the University of Cambridge whose book, Mafia Expansion, about the rise of the ‘Ndrangheta in Germany, was published this month. “It’s the perfect storm: a combination of fragmented policing, political neglect, weak legislation especially in relation to money laundering, and excessive data protection have made Germany a paradise for criminal operations.”
Organised crime’s lifeblood is cocaine. But the authorities are being hopelessly outfought. Despite all the work by law enforcement in targeting the cocaine trade in Europe, supply is plentiful and, unlike most products, it costs around the same as 10 years ago. When the Dutch spent €524m increasing port security in response to a wave of gangland executions linked to the cocaine trade, the gangs just switched to ports in France, Spain, Portugal, Scandinavia and the Baltics.
Cocaine seizures at Hamburg were down in 2024, but the drug is still arriving in abundance: on small boats into smaller north German ports or via “parasite smuggling”, where cocaine is attached to the outside of cargo ship hulls and retrieved by divers at the destination port.
But catching the gangsters themselves is not enough, criminologists warn, and the search for corruption needs to go deeper.
“Cocaine trafficking and the associated money laundering in Germany can only function on a large scale through corruption of public officials and other facilitators. But the focus of investigators is only on the perpetrators within the criminal networks,” said Robin Hofmann, a specialist in organised crime at Maastricht University. Instead, Hofmann said, as has been done in the Netherlands, the search for the infiltration of cocaine money must be widened further “to the facilitators, the lawyers, local politicians and financial advisers who enable organised crime and profit from it”.

제목: Final autopsy results on Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, reveal complex health issues

본문:
Two months after the actorGene Hackmanand his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead in their home in Santa Fe, final autopsy results on the couple have been released.
These shed further light on the state of health of Hackman, 95, at the time when his and his wife’s bodies, along with that of one of their dogs, were found by a maintenance worker on 26 February. It is believed that Hackman died around a week after his wife, whose cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare rodent-borne disease.
Hackman’s autopsy “showed severe atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease with placement of coronary artery stents and a bypass graft, as well as a previous aortic valve replacement,” said the report, which was obtained by Fox News Digital.
“Remote myocardial infarctions were present involving the left ventricular free wall and the septum, which were significantly large. Examination of the brain showed microscopic findings of advanced stage Alzheimer’s disease.”
According to the autopsy, Hackman had been fitted with a “bi-ventricular pacemaker” since April 2019. His estimated date of death was determined by the last recorded activity on this device, while Arakawa’s was judged to be 12 February – the last date she corresponded by email or telephone.
It is understood that Hackman might not have appreciated his wife was dead in the six days after her passing, such was the level of his dementia.
The autopsy also noted Hackman had a “history of congestive heart failure” as well as “severe chronic hypertensive changes, kidneys” and “neurodegenerative features consistent with Alzheimer’s disease”.
Early investigations ruled out death by carbon monoxide poisoning, while a necropsy report confirmed that Arakawa had died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare rodent-borne disease.
Confusion over the circumstances of the death of Hackman, Arakawa and their kelpie mix, Zinna, has persisted since the discovery of their bodies (two other dogs were found alive and well).
Initial suspicions that they died of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning were confounded by the findings that Arakawa had died of the rare respiratory condition.
Hantavirus pulmonary disease is fatal in nearly four out of 10 people who are infected, but fewer than 730 cases were identified in the US between 1993 and 2017.
Further police investigations of their grounds discovered widespread evidence of rodent infestation. Meanwhile, recently released body cam footage of the local police department’s first visit to the property suggested the couple may have struggled to keep their home under control, while a discarded plaster indicated Arakawa might have been bitten by a rodent.
Further questions have also been raised about why the couple did not have a more robust care package in place.

제목: Trump ‘makes trade deal with UK second-order priority’ in blow to ministers
링크: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/29/trump-makes-trade-deal-with-uk-second-order-priority-in-blow-to-ministers
본문:
Donald Trump has made a trade deal with the UK a second-order priority, sources have told the Guardian, hampering British attempts to meet their mid-May deadline.
US officials have decided to split their negotiations with more than a dozen other countries into three phases, with the UK being placed in either phase two or three, according to people who have been briefed on the talks.
A trade deal with the US would be the biggest prize for British negotiators, who made major strides toward separate agreements with the EU and India on Tuesday.
But UK officials fear that a deal with the EU, which they hope to agree at a summit on 19 May, could make it more difficult to negotiate with a Trump administration that repeatedly criticises European trade policies.
One person with knowledge of the US talks said: “The US has now decided to negotiate its trade deals in three phases. The government has been told it will not be in phase one – though that leaves the door open to be in either phase two or three.”
A spokesperson for the business department said: “The US is an indispensable ally and negotiations on an economic prosperity deal that strengthens our existing trading relationship continue.
“We’ve been clear that a trade war is not in anyone’s interests and we will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks.”
The White House did not respond to a request to comment.
British officials first presented a draft deal to their US counterparts weeks ago, before the president’smajor tariff announcement. They hoped to agree a deal in time to grant the UK an exemption but, when that failed, shifted their focus instead to a self-imposed deadline of 19 May.
Whitehall sources say, however, that negotiations have continued to be unpredictable in the weeks since Trump made his announcement. US officials are nowreportedly demandingthe UK lower its food quality standards to allow imports of American beef and chicken – something the Labour government has long ruled out.
The draft agreement prepared by the British side would lead to the UKreducing its digital services tax, which is paid only by major US technology companies, in return for lower tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has also held out the possibility of reducing the 10% tariffs on US cars as an additional sweetener.
But in the past few days the Trump administration has decided to split its negotiations with 17 different countries into three groups, each of which will get a week to negotiate in turn – a developmentfirst reportedby the Wall Street Journal. The US has imposed a deadline of 8 July for talks to conclude – several weeks later than the UK target.
Sources said UK officials had been told the immediate priority would be negotiating with Asian countries, with South Korea at the top of the list.
Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, told reporters on Tuesday that Asian trading partners such as India, South Korea and Japan “have been the most forthcoming, in terms of doing the deals”.
He also criticised European countries for imposing digital services taxes on US companies, saying he wanted them to be removed. The British government has offered to reduce the tax but not to drop it entirely.
Despite the new negotiating approach from the Trump administration, British negotiators are hopeful they will be able to continue talks – even if in a more unofficial capacity – throughout the next few weeks.
One government source described the US tactics as “makeshift and unpredictable”. Another said contact had continued in the past few days despite the promised phasing of talks.
However, the UK is making better headway with India and the EU.
Negotiators held crunch talks on Tuesday afternoon with their Indian counterparts, after Piyush Goyal, India’s trade minister, told businesses at a roundtable in London that 25 out of 26 aspects of the deal had been agreed.
UK officials were hopeful of finalising the deal on Tuesday, but one source briefed on the talks said they broke up without agreement on national insurance contributions. A longstanding sticking point has been Delhi’s concern that Indians working temporarily in the UK on business visas must pay national insurance despite not being eligible for UK pensions or social security benefits.
The expectation is that at least one more round of talks will be needed to clinch any deal. Officials are in discussions over a potential visit byKeir Starmerto India this year once an agreement has been finalised.
Meanwhile, British ministers including Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, and Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, met Maroš Šefčovič, the EU trade commissioner, amid signs that a UK-EU deal could be getting closer.
Šefčovičtweeted afterwardsit had been “a productive exchange on securing balanced trade relationships, as we face new global dynamics”.
The Guardianrevealed last weekthat Brussels was willing to make major concessions to its proposals for a youth mobility scheme to get a deal over the line, including limiting work visas to 12 months, restricting the sectors EU citizens can work in.
However, experts say that the plans to align British agricultural standards with European ones would make it impossible to give concessions on US demands to align with US ones instead.
Anand Menon, the director of the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, told MPs on Tuesday: “If the Americans say you have to lift the regulations that restrict the access of our goods to your market, that is incompatible with what we need to do to sign a … deal with the EU.”

The rally featured guest speeches by Brian Pannebecker, a retired car worker who pitched a book he is writing about his support of Trump, and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller,who said earnestly: “Thank you, President Trump, for being the greatest president in American history.”
Democrats take a different view.Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: “Trump’s pathetic display tonight will do nothing to help the families he started screwing over 100 days ago.
“Michiganders and the rest of the country see right through Trump, and as a result, he has the lowest 100-day approval rating in generations. If he’s not already terrified of what the ballot box will bring between now and the midterm elections, he should be.”

제목: Cocaine, corruption and bribes: the German port under siege by Europe’s criminal drug gangs
링크: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/cocaine-corruption-bribes-german-port-under-siege-europe-criminal-drug-gangs-hamburg

In Hamburg’s spring sunshine, 200,000-tonne cargo ships almost half a mile long, piled high with the same weight in shipping containers, are docked quayside along the Elbe River. Cranes slowly offload the metal boxes packed with everything from raw materials to food and electronics, and, in some, cocaine.
Between 2018 and 2023 cocaine seizures rose by 750%, marking outGermanyas another major European hub in the ever-expanding global trade. But the influx is not just ramping up addiction, it is also fuelling corruption in a country perceived as being one of the least corrupt in the world.
“We are seeing ​​an infiltration of the port infrastructure in Hamburg, bribing of police officers in exchange for information and lately a state attorney awaiting trial for [allegedly] leaking information to a cocaine trafficking network,” said Daniel Brombacher, who runs theEuropebureau at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.
In 2021, police announced Europe’s biggest ever seizure of cocaine at the port: 16 tonnes of high-purity powder stashed in 1,700 wall-putty tins shipped from Paraguay to Hamburg. The lead public prosecutor in that case was in court last week accused of being on the payroll of the same gang he was supposed to be prosecuting.
The man, named as Yashar G, is accused of leaking investigation details to the gang and warning suspects of their imminent arrest in return for €5,000 (£4,250) a month. He was arrested in October by police monitoring the gang’s encrypted communications – when police raided the network shortly after the Hamburg seizure, key targets had already fled to Dubai. Yashar G is also accused of leaking sensitive information to other drug gangs. He denies all allegations against him.
Cocaine production in Colombia and its consumption in western Europe are hitting record highs. So too is the money being made by European organised crime networks distributing a product worth more by weight than platinum. A kilo of cocaine is worth $2,000 in Colombia, but once in Europe its value rockets to an average of $40,000. Profits from this huge mark-up are not just spent on luxury cars and villas, but used to smooth the path for the next shipment as the gangster creep digs its tentacles into countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Germany.
Hamburg, the European Union’s third largest port is one of its most targeted ports by drug gangs, according to Europol. Insiders known ashafeninnentäter(including dock and shipping workers, security guards and truck drivers) move the drugs unnoticed. Two Hamburg port workers were this month jailed for helping transport 480kg of cocaine from Ecuador and enabling a physical attack on a colleague who threatened the plot.
Police have launched a publicity campaign to help port workers fend off drug gangs trying to recruit or extort them, but Hamburg’s port security forces feel so under threat they last year demanded submachine guns. In one incident Belgian police tipped off Hamburg’s port police that an armed French drug gang was planning a raid to recover seized cocaine.
Cocaine’s profits meanwhile spill out on to Hamburg’s streets. “Karl”, a former bouncer in the city’s red light district, said money from cocaine has become increasingly visible in the last five years. “Every weekend you see more and more young men in Ferraris, Lamborghinis and €150,000 SUVs,” he said. “This is not money earned from prostitution, or scams or cannabis. This is cocaine money.”
A series of cases in Germany have also highlighted alleged corruption within police ranks: an officer in the south-western state of Baden-Württemberg arrested this month on suspicion of being on the Italian ‘Ndrangheta mafia’s payroll, a senior police officer in Hanover suspected of taking bribes from a drug trafficking network arrested in January, a drug squad officer arrested near Frankfurt in November on charges of “aiding and abetting” drug dealers and a police officer arrested in Bonn in August who was accused of passing classified information to members of the Dutch-Moroccan mafia, big players in Europe’s drug trade.
“The cocaine bonanza that we have witnessed in Germany and the EU in the past decade has led to an unprecedented influx of cash into organised crime,” said Brombacher. “Organised crime groups have never had so much venture capital available, and also never before such a strong incentive to invest in bribing to make sure the business keeps moving.”
Hamburg Port Authority said issues linked to port security were dealt with by Hamburg police. In a statement, a spokesperson for the police said: “International organised criminal groups are often recruiting employees of the port industry in order to support the smuggling of cocaine from South America into Germany and Europe via the port of Hamburg. These so-called ‘internal port offenders’ are playing a particular key role in this kind of illegal drug importation.”
The spokesperson said the police, alongside customs, the port authority and the private sector, were “making significant efforts to combat this issue”. They added: “So far, cases of bribed police officers have not been proven in Hamburg in this context.”
Organised crime experts have warned that the true nature of corruption brought by drug trafficking networks remains hidden.
“Germany has found it very difficult to admit its problem with organised crime and still today it is largely in denial. The sudden influx of cocaine has just started to make the problem visible,” said Zora Hauser, a criminologist at the University of Cambridge whose book, Mafia Expansion, about the rise of the ‘Ndrangheta in Germany, was published this month. “It’s the perfect storm: a combination of fragmented policing, political neglect, weak legislation especially in relation to money laundering, and excessive data protection have made Germany a paradise for criminal operations.”
Organised crime’s lifeblood is cocaine. But the authorities are being hopelessly outfought. Despite all the work by law enforcement in targeting the cocaine trade in Europe, supply is plentiful and, unlike most products, it costs around the same as 10 years ago. When the Dutch spent €524m increasing port security in response to a wave of gangland executions linked to the cocaine trade, the gangs just switched to ports in France, Spain, Portugal, Scandinavia and the Baltics.
Cocaine seizures at Hamburg were down in 2024, but the drug is still arriving in abundance: on small boats into smaller north German ports or via “parasite smuggling”, where cocaine is attached to the outside of cargo ship hulls and retrieved by divers at the destination port.
But catching the gangsters themselves is not enough, criminologists warn, and the search for corruption needs to go deeper.
“Cocaine trafficking and the associated money laundering in Germany can only function on a large scale through corruption of public officials and other facilitators. But the focus of investigators is only on the perpetrators within the criminal networks,” said Robin Hofmann, a specialist in organised crime at Maastricht University. Instead, Hofmann said, as has been done in the Netherlands, the search for the infiltration of cocaine money must be widened further “to the facilitators, the lawyers, local politicians and financial advisers who enable organised crime and profit from it”.

제목: Final autopsy results on Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, reveal complex health issues
링크: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/28/gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa-final-autopsy-results-complex-health-issues
본문:
Two months after the actorGene Hackmanand his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead in their home in Santa Fe, final autopsy results on the couple have been released.
These shed further light on the state of health of Hackman, 95, at the time when his and his wife’s bodies, along with that of one of their dogs, were found by a maintenance worker on 26 February. It is believed that Hackman died around a week after his wife, whose cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare rodent-borne disease.
Hackman’s autopsy “showed severe atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease with placement of coronary artery stents and a bypass graft, as well as a previous aortic valve replacement,” said the report, which was obtained by Fox News Digital.
“Remote myocardial infarctions were present involving the left ventricular free wall and the septum, which were significantly large. Examination of the brain showed microscopic findings of advanced stage Alzheimer’s disease.”
According to the autopsy, Hackman had been fitted with a “bi-ventricular pacemaker” since April 2019. His estimated date of death was determined by the last recorded activity on this device, while Arakawa’s was judged to be 12 February – the last date she corresponded by email or telephone.
It is understood that Hackman might not have appreciated his wife was dead in the six days after her passing, such was the level of his dementia.
The autopsy also noted Hackman had a “history of congestive heart failure” as well as “severe chronic hypertensive changes, kidneys” and “neurodegenerative features consistent with Alzheimer’s disease”.
Early investigations ruled out death by carbon monoxide poisoning, while a necropsy report confirmed that Arakawa had died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare rodent-borne disease.
Confusion over the circumstances of the death of Hackman, Arakawa and their kelpie mix, Zinna, has persisted since the discovery of their bodies (two other dogs were found alive and well).
Initial suspicions that they died of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning were confounded by the findings that Arakawa had died of the rare respiratory condition.
Hantavirus pulmonary disease is fatal in nearly four out of 10 people who are infected, but fewer than 730 cases were identified in the US between 1993 and 2017.
Further police investigations of their grounds discovered widespread evidence of rodent infestation. Meanwhile, recently released body cam footage of the local police department’s first visit to the property suggested the couple may have struggled to keep their home under control, while a discarded plaster indicated Arakawa might have been bitten by a rodent.
Further questions have also been raised about why the couple did not have a more robust care package in place.

제목: Trump ‘makes trade deal with UK second-order priority’ in blow to ministers
링크: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/29/trump-makes-trade-deal-with-uk-second-order-priority-in-blow-to-ministers
본문:
Donald Trump has made a trade deal with the UK a second-order priority, sources have told the Guardian, hampering British attempts to meet their mid-May deadline.
US officials have decided to split their negotiations with more than a dozen other countries into three phases, with the UK being placed in either phase two or three, according to people who have been briefed on the talks.
A trade deal with the US would be the biggest prize for British negotiators, who made major strides toward separate agreements with the EU and India on Tuesday.
But UK officials fear that a deal with the EU, which they hope to agree at a summit on 19 May, could make it more difficult to negotiate with a Trump administration that repeatedly criticises European trade policies.
One person with knowledge of the US talks said: “The US has now decided to negotiate its trade deals in three phases. The government has been told it will not be in phase one – though that leaves the door open to be in either phase two or three.”
A spokesperson for the business department said: “The US is an indispensable ally and negotiations on an economic prosperity deal that strengthens our existing trading relationship continue.
“We’ve been clear that a trade war is not in anyone’s interests and we will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks.”
The White House did not respond to a request to comment.
British officials first presented a draft deal to their US counterparts weeks ago, before the president’smajor tariff announcement. They hoped to agree a deal in time to grant the UK an exemption but, when that failed, shifted their focus instead to a self-imposed deadline of 19 May.
Whitehall sources say, however, that negotiations have continued to be unpredictable in the weeks since Trump made his announcement. US officials are nowreportedly demandingthe UK lower its food quality standards to allow imports of American beef and chicken – something the Labour government has long ruled out.
The draft agreement prepared by the British side would lead to the UKreducing its digital services tax, which is paid only by major US technology companies, in return for lower tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has also held out the possibility of reducing the 10% tariffs on US cars as an additional sweetener.
But in the past few days the Trump administration has decided to split its negotiations with 17 different countries into three groups, each of which will get a week to negotiate in turn – a developmentfirst reportedby the Wall Street Journal. The US has imposed a deadline of 8 July for talks to conclude – several weeks later than the UK target.
Sources said UK officials had been told the immediate priority would be negotiating with Asian countries, with South Korea at the top of the list.
Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, told reporters on Tuesday that Asian trading partners such as India, South Korea and Japan “have been the most forthcoming, in terms of doing the deals”.
He also criticised European countries for imposing digital services taxes on US companies, saying he wanted them to be removed. The British government has offered to reduce the tax but not to drop it entirely.
Despite the new negotiating approach from the Trump administration, British negotiators are hopeful they will be able to continue talks – even if in a more unofficial capacity – throughout the next few weeks.
One government source described the US tactics as “makeshift and unpredictable”. Another said contact had continued in the past few days despite the promised phasing of talks.
However, the UK is making better headway with India and the EU.
Negotiators held crunch talks on Tuesday afternoon with their Indian counterparts, after Piyush Goyal, India’s trade minister, told businesses at a roundtable in London that 25 out of 26 aspects of the deal had been agreed.
UK officials were hopeful of finalising the deal on Tuesday, but one source briefed on the talks said they broke up without agreement on national insurance contributions. A longstanding sticking point has been Delhi’s concern that Indians working temporarily in the UK on business visas must pay national insurance despite not being eligible for UK pensions or social security benefits.
The expectation is that at least one more round of talks will be needed to clinch any deal. Officials are in discussions over a potential visit byKeir Starmerto India this year once an agreement has been finalised.
Meanwhile, British ministers including Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, and Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, met Maroš Šefčovič, the EU trade commissioner, amid signs that a UK-EU deal could be getting closer.
Šefčovičtweeted afterwardsit had been “a productive exchange on securing balanced trade relationships, as we face new global dynamics”.
The Guardianrevealed last weekthat Brussels was willing to make major concessions to its proposals for a youth mobility scheme to get a deal over the line, including limiting work visas to 12 months, restricting the sectors EU citizens can work in.
However, experts say that the plans to align British agricultural standards with European ones would make it impossible to give concessions on US demands to align with US ones instead.
Anand Menon, the director of the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, told MPs on Tuesday: “If the Americans say you have to lift the regulations that restrict the access of our goods to your market, that is incompatible with what we need to do to sign a … deal with the EU.”
